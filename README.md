# First-Person-Farm-Experience-Unity-Game
This is a project designed for my MSTU5199 Unity Development class. 

## Learning Goals

#### Plants / Crops
"First-Person-Farm-Experience" is a game that helps kids learn to take care of farm plants

#### Farm Experience
An immersive farm experience to help everyone de-stress as a little getaway from the urban life.

## Design Rationale


#### Tools
Farm animal
Bucket & well for getting water
Rake for softening the soil

#### HPs (Health Points)
Player HP
Chicken HP
Plant HP

#### Interfaces
HPs board
Tools board
Instruction

## Challenges

#### First Person Controller: Learned to set the interactions between objects and player

#### Change of theme: Constantly changing the theme and game mechanics and did not have a fixed theme until a month ago

## Future Improvements

#### Collider: Might be a problem with my Unity version?

#### Correct Order of Steps: 
1. Rake the soil
2. Plant the seeds
3. Water the plant

#### Playable, but not working great: More styling to make the game look better
